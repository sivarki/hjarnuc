# RpcArgs Arguments

The RpcArgs struct has helper functions to be able to get the variables that were sent across the network as arguments. There are two main functions to achieve this behavior **RpcArgs::GetNext<T>** and **RpcArgs::GetAt<T>**. When you call a RPC the arguments provided are received in the order that they were sent. The **GetAt** call will allow you to provide the index you wish to get. So if you were to do something like **SendRpc(" MyRpcFunc", Receivers.All, "cat", 9, true)** then if you were to call **args.GetAt<int>(1)** you would get the value **9**. The **GetNext** method has an internal counter that is used to quickly go through and get all of the variables. So using the same **MyRpcFunc** example above you could do the following:
